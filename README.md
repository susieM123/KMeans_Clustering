# K-Means Clustering
### Susie Mueller

## Objectives

In this project, you will implement the K-means clustering algorithm for clustering data (performing unsupervised learning). You will test and plot K-means clusters with a simple 2D dataset, then use the algorithm to compress the colorspace of images and segment regions with similar colors.

## Goals

- Explore, implement, and analyze the results from the K-means clustering algorithm.
- Visualize the results of K-means.
- Apply clustering to segment and compress color images.


## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **NumPy** – for numerical computation  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – for visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for iterative development and presentation
